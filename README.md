A project to build a Moodle server and Wi-Fi router on a Raspberry Pi 3.

## The MoodleBox Documentation

Visit the [MoodleBox web site](https://moodlebox.net) for more information about the MoodleBox features or any question about the usage of a MoodleBox.

### Asking Support Questions

We have an active [discussion forum](https://discuss.moodlebox.net/) where users and developers can ask questions. Please don't use the GitHub issue tracker to ask questions.

## Building the MoodleBox disk image from scratch

> If you just want to use a MoodleBox, __you don't need__ to build the MoodleBox disk image yourself. Just [download the MoodleBox image](https://moodlebox.net/download) and follow the instructions on the [MoodleBox web site](https://moodlebox.net).

To build a MoodleBox from scratch with this script, you need a Raspberri Pi 3 or 3B+ (Wi-Fi!).

1. Clone Rasbpian Stretch Lite on your microSD card.
1. Create a `ssh` file on the `boot` partition, e.g. using `touch ssh`.
1. Insert the microSD card into your Raspberry.
1. Connect your Raspberry to your Ethernet network and boot it.
1. [Install Ansible](https://docs.ansible.com/intro_installation.html) on your computer.
1. [Install `sshpass`](https://gist.github.com/arunoda/7790979) to enable passing SSH password to the $raspberry. On macOS, use e.g. `brew install https://git.io/sshpass.rb`.
1. [Clone this repository](https://github.com/moodlebox/moodlebox.git) to your local drive.
1. Create a `keys` directory in the repository folder and copy your public key into it, under the name `id_rsa.pub`.
1. Get the IP address of your RaspberryPi and change it in the `hosts.yml` file. Do not change anything else, unless you know what you're doing. You're on your own.
1. Run `ansible-playbook moodlebox.yml` from the repository folder.
1. Wait 30–50 minutes, depending on your SD card and Internet bandwidth. You're done.

### Overriding defaults

You can override any of the defaults configured in `default.config.yml` by creating a `config.yml` file and setting the overrides in that file. For example, you can change the MoodleBox main credentials and the timezone with something like:

    moodlebox_username: 'myusername'
    moodlebox_password: 'secret'
    moodlebox_timezone: 'Australia/Perth'

Any variable can be overridden in `config.yml`; see the file `default.config.yml` for a list of available variables.

## Availability

The code is available at [https://github.com/moodlebox/moodlebox](https://github.com/moodlebox/moodlebox).

If you just want to use a MoodleBox, a [prepared disk image](https://moodlebox.net/download) of the latest released version is [available for downloading](https://moodlebox.net/download), cloning on your microSD card and using out of the box on your Raspberry Pi 3.
